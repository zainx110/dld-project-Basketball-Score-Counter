Our project boasted a start screen crafted through pixel generation, transitioning seamlessly into the main score screen triggered by a switch. Utilizing IR sensors integrated with basketball hoops, we engineered a system where scores incremented upon ball detection, displayed vividly on the VGA monitor. With a timer set at 2 minutes, our logic seamlessly compared scores at the end, determining the winning team or displaying a tie on the VGA monitor.
